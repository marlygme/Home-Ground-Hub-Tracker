# Fixed: Cloudflare Pages Deployment Issue

## The Problem
Your deployed site at https://home-ground-hub-tracker.pages.dev was showing a blank screen on mobile because the Cloudflare Pages Functions were failing with 500 errors.

## Root Cause
The Cloudflare Functions were trying to import from `@shared/schema` which is a Vite/TypeScript alias that doesn't work in the Cloudflare Workers runtime.

## The Fix
Changed `server/db/cloudflare.ts` to use a relative import path instead:
```typescript
// Before (broken in Cloudflare):
import * as schema from "@shared/schema";

// After (works everywhere):
import * as schema from "../../shared/schema";
```

## What Was Fixed
1. ✅ **Import path issue** - Changed alias to relative path in `server/db/cloudflare.ts`
2. ✅ **Error handling** - Added detailed logging to Cloudflare Functions
3. ✅ **Error display** - Frontend now shows clear error messages if APIs fail
4. ✅ **Data safety** - Added guards against deleted programs in storage layer
5. ✅ **Multi-program support** - Participants can now belong to multiple programs

## How to Deploy

### Step 1: Commit and Push
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Cloudflare deployment: use relative imports for schema"
git push
```

### Step 2: Verify Environment Variable
Go to https://dash.cloudflare.com and check:
- Navigate to: Workers & Pages → home-ground-hub-tracker → Settings → Environment variables
- Ensure `DATABASE_URL` is set for **Production**:
  ```
  postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_JU1f5FacGPNj@ep-nameless-firefly-a7udfon9-pooler.ap-southeast-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require&channel_binding=require
  ```

### Step 3: Wait for Deployment
- Cloudflare Pages will automatically detect your git push
- Wait 1-2 minutes for the build and deployment
- Check the deployments tab to see progress

### Step 4: Test
Visit https://home-ground-hub-tracker.pages.dev on your mobile device and you should see:
- All 22 participants loaded
- Multiple program badges on each participant card
- Fully functional multi-program support

## What's Next (Optional)
The attendance tracking components need updating for the new multi-program model:
- `AttendanceTracker.tsx` - needs to handle multiple programs per participant
- `BulkAttendanceDialog.tsx` - needs to support multi-program filtering

These can be updated in a future session if you need them.

## Verification
You can verify the fix is working by:
1. Check that the site loads and shows participants
2. Open browser DevTools → Network tab
3. Look for successful 200 responses from `/api/programs` and `/api/participants`
4. If errors occur, you can now see detailed error messages on screen

Your data is safe - all 22 participants are in the database and ready to display!
