Fix Cloudflare Pages deployment with multi-program support

- Fixed module import in server/db/cloudflare.ts (use relative path instead of alias)
- Updated all components to use ParticipantWithPrograms type
- Fixed TypeScript errors in AttendanceTracker, BulkAttendanceDialog, StatisticsView, PrintView
- Updated exportUtils to handle multi-program participants
- Added null-safety guards for deleted programs in storage layer
- Removed old localStorage.ts file

This fixes the blank screen issue on the deployed site.
